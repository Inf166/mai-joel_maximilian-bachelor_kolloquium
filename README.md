# Investigating the theory-practice gap of Scrum

> Bachelor Kolloquium Presentation

In this presentation, we will explore the theory-practice gap in Scrum, a popular agile project management framework, and its implications for organizations. Utilizing reveal.js and following the style guide from the TH Köln, this presentation will provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of Scrum and identify the factors contributing to the gap between its theoretical foundations and practical implementation.

Starting with a brief overview of Scrum and its principles, we will examine case studies of organizations that have successfully adopted Scrum and those that have struggled with its implementation. We will also discuss the common challenges faced by organizations, such as resistance to change, lack of understanding, and insufficient training.

Furthermore, this presentation will propose potential solutions to close the theory-practice gap of Scrum, including best practices for training and coaching, effective communication, and ongoing evaluation and improvement. Through interactive examples and visual aids, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the importance of bridging the theory-practice gap in Scrum and its impact on organizational success.
